C01 - Overview
new way to generate a zombie is to make it feed and inject virus to other humans and new zombie's DNA will be generated based on the attacking zombie's DNA and the human's (host's) DNA



C02 - Mappings and Address
making our game multiplayer by giving the zombies in our db an owner

*Addresses
Ethereum blockchain is made up of accounts, having addresses belonging to a particular person (owner) or a smart contract.

*Mappings
a more complex data-type for key-value pair storing and looking up data.
ex: mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance; 
mapping can be accessed and used like accessing elements in an array
ex: accountBalance[msg.sender] = _amount;



C03 - Msg.sender
a type of global variable available to all functions - refers to the address of the person (or smart contract) who called the current function



C04 - Require
basically the if statement of solidity
will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true
ex: function sayHiToVitalik(string memory _name) public returns (string memory) {
    require((keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));
    return "Hi";
    //here using keccak256 as solidity doesn't have native string comparison, so we compare the hashes generated with keccak256 for the strings, if they're equal
}
